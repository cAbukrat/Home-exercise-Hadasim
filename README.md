# Ex1 - Web application for managing Corona for the HMO
It is a **NodeJS** end-to-end application-based **Rest API** that provides data about HMO members.
I developed the front end with **React/Redux**, and the back end with Node.js and **Express**.
The architecture is divided into Business and Data Layers.
The servers manage database implemented by MongoDB and object modeling was done by **Mongoose**

The architecture detail is in the "System architecture specification" file (Includes client side screenshots).
